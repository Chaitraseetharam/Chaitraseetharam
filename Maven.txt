mvn --version

mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false

cd my-app

Under this directory you will notice the following standard project structure.

my-app
|-- pom.xml
`-- src
    |-- main
    |   `-- java
    |       `-- com
    |           `-- mycompany
    |               `-- app
    |                   `-- App.java
    `-- test
        `-- java
            `-- com
                `-- mycompany
                    `-- app
                        `-- AppTest.java

mvn compile


mvn commands will work only in the directory where pom.xml is present

pom.xml always present in 

The src/main/java directory contains the project source code, the src/test/java directory contains the test source, and the pom.xml file is the project's Project Object Model, or POM.

The POM
The pom.xml file is the core of a project's configuration in Maven. It is a single configuration file that contains the majority of information required to build a project in just the way you want. The POM is huge and can be daunting in its complexity, but it is not necessary to understand all of the intricacies just yet to use it effectively. This project's POM is:

<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
 
  <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>
  <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
 
  <properties>
    <maven.compiler.source>1.7</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>1.7</maven.compiler.target>
  </properties>
 
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>junit</groupId>
      <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
      <version>4.12</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</project>







Build the Project
mvn package
The command line will print out various actions, and end with the following:

 ...
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  2.953 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2019-11-24T13:05:10+01:00
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlike the first command executed (archetype:generate), the second is simply a single word - package. Rather than a goal, this is a phase. A phase is a step in the build lifecycle, which is an ordered sequence of phases. When a phase is given, Maven executes every phase in the sequence up to and including the one defined. For example, if you execute the compile phase, the phases that actually get executed are:

validate
generate-sources
process-sources
generate-resources
process-resources
compile
You may test the newly compiled and packaged JAR with the following command:

java -cp target/my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.mycompany.app.App
Which will print the quintessential:

Hello World!


Java 9 or later
By default your version of Maven might use an old version of the maven-compiler-plugin that is not compatible with Java 9 or later versions. To target Java 9 or later, you should at least use version 3.6.0 of the maven-compiler-plugin and set the maven.compiler.release property to the Java release you are targetting (e.g. 9, 10, 11, 12, etc.).

In the following example, we have configured our Maven project to use version 3.8.1 of maven-compiler-plugin and target Java 11:

    <properties>
        <maven.compiler.release>11</maven.compiler.release>
    </properties>
 
    <build>
        <pluginManagement>
            <plugins>
                <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                    <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>3.8.1</version>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </pluginManagement>
    </build>

Running Maven Tools
Maven Phases
Although hardly a comprehensive list, these are the most common default lifecycle phases executed.

validate: validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
compile: compile the source code of the project
test: test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
package: take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
integration-test: process and deploy the package if necessary into an environment where integration tests can be run
verify: run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria
install: install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
deploy: done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
There are two other Maven lifecycles of note beyond the default list above. They are

clean: cleans up artifacts created by prior builds
site: generates site documentation for this project
Phases are actually mapped to underlying goals. The specific goals executed per phase is dependant upon the packaging type of the project. For example, package executes jar:jar if the project type is a JAR, and war:war if the project type is - you guessed it - a WAR.

An interesting thing to note is that phases and goals may be executed in sequence.

mvn clean dependency:copy-dependencies package
This command will clean the project, copy dependencies, and package the project (executing all phases up to package, of course).

Generating the Site
mvn site
This phase generates a site based upon information on the project's pom. You can look at the documentation generated under target/site.
